I am a PhD Scholar in the Discipline of Electrical Engineering at nanoDC Lab, IIT Gandhinagar, working with [Prof. Nihar Ranjan Mohapatra](https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/ee/fac-nihar). I am currently working on designing efficient 2D material contacts to handle contact resistance, which can be used in designing efficient 2D material-based MOSFETs and Reconfigurable FETs.
